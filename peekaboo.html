    <h1>Play Peek a boo</h1>
    <p>The baby is unbearably loud so you decide to catch him surprise to make him forget about whatever's troubling him. You suddenly cover his eyes with both of your hands. The crying comes to a halt. However, when you take your hands off, the baby is approached by your scary face and a loud "PEEKABOO!" and he starts crying again.</p>
