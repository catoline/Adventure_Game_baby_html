    <h1>Give the baby your keys.</h1>
    <p>You rummage around your pockets to find something to satisfy the baby's boredom. You find your keys and your phone. Keys are a bad idea, you think. The baby could cut himself. You hand him your phone instead. The baby throws it as far as he can with his tiny little arm and lands it in his cup of milk. Your phone is ruined and the baby starts crying again.</p>
