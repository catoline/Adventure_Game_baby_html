    <h1>Give the baby a stuffed animal.</h1>
    <p>You scan the room to find something for the baby to play with. You find an old stuffed rabbit that will probably do the job. You put the rabbit on the baby's lap and suddenly see a stream of drool trickling down. The baby's bored. Now he starts crying again just to bother you.</p>
