    <h1>You give the baby you keys to play with.</h1>
    <p>You rummage around your pockets to find something for the baby to play with. You find keys and your phone. You figure that your phone is no good because it cannot be dropped, so you give the baby your keys. Uh oh. The baby giggles and drops the keys on his face at such a perfect angle that the keys cut him clean in the cheek.</p>
